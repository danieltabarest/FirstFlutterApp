# How to start?
Clone flutter repository 
git clone -b beta https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git

Type: flutter doctor , which downloads additional dependencies
flutter doctor

# Editor 
With plugin IntelliJ Idea (CE or Enterprise) 
Android Studio 
Visual Studio Code Or anything else using console

Install the Flutter and Dart plugins
To install these:

Start Android Studio or IntelliJ.
Open plugin preferences (Preferences > Plugins on macOS, File > Settings > Plugins on Windows & Linux).
Select Browse repositories, select the Flutter plugin and click Install.
Click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
Click Restart when prompted.

# StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget
A StatelessWidget will never rebuild by itself (but can from external events). A StatefulWidget can. That is the golden rule.

Stateless only means that all of its properties are immutable and that the only way to change them is to create a new instance of that widget.
